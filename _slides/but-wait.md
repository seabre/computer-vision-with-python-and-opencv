## But wait

There's still a bunch of junk in the background when I move around. How can that can be gotten rid of?

We can keep track of three frames, perform the difference of <sup>i</sup><sub>1</sub> - <sup>i</sup><sub>0</sub> and <sup>i</sup><sub>2</sub> - <sup>i</sup><sub>1</sub>.

Then, using those two differences, perform bitwise and on the two differences.
