## My demo

My demo uses a camera to continuously detect movement.

On each frame, it divides up the processed frame into a 8x8 grid.

If it finds motion is detected in a cell, the BananaPi sends my laptop, running sound synthesis software, the specific cell and the synthesis software plays an assigned note.
